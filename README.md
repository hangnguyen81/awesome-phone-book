# awesome-phone-book
This project was built with MERN stack (React, Nodejs, Express, MongoDB) and deploy to Heroku

This app is based on an required exercise in Full Stack Open course and I got inspiration for interface of the App from this article [Crafting React with love](https://dev.solita.fi/2016/07/20/crafting-react-with-love.html)

**In this app, you can:**
- Add contact (first name, last name and phone number), all fiels are required
- Delete contact
- Update contact by filling the same first name and last name and different phone number
- Search contact as you type

A quick look of the App.
