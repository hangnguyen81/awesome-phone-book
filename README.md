# awesome-phone-book
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using React hooks, axios and json-server!  

This app is based on an required exercise in Full Stack Open course and I got inspiration for interface of the App from this article [Crafting React with love](https://dev.solita.fi/2016/07/20/crafting-react-with-love.html)

**In this app, you can:**
- Add contact (first name, last name and phone number), all fiels are required
- Delete contact
- Update contact by filling the same first name and last name and different phone number
- Search contact as you type

A quick look of the App.
