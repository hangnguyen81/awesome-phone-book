# awesome-phone-book
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using React Hooks. I will continue to update some functions of the phone book later!

This app was created based on a required exercise in Full Stact Open couse. I got inspiration for interface of the App from this article [Crafting React with love](https://dev.solita.fi/2016/07/20/crafting-react-with-love.html)

A quick look of the App.
