This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using React hooks, axios and json-server!  

I am trying to find the way to deploy this app so it can run in the internet but I have not found the way to make json-server work in GitHub, trying typicode with fake API for testing but it does not work well.

This app was created based on a required exercise in Full Stact Open couse. I got inspiration for interface of the App from this article [Crafting React with love](https://dev.solita.fi/2016/07/20/crafting-react-with-love.html)

A quick look of the App.
